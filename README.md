OneBusAway for Windows Phone
========================

### Project Description
OneBusAway for Windows is an app for Windows Mobile 10 devices with transit information for the Seattle, WA, Tampa, FL, and Atlanta, GA regions, and potentially any other region that sets up a [OneBusAway server](http://onebusaway.org/).

The latest stable release is available for download from the [WP Marketplace](http://www.windowsphone.com/en-us/store/app/onebusaway/30dcbcc4-e3d0-df11-9eae-00237de2db9e?type=phoneapp&id=30dcbcc4-e3d0-df11-9eae-00237de2db9e&source=onebusawaysite).
